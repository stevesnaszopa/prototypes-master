  <!-- Loan conditions 16 -->

  <h2>Loan Conditions</h2>

  <p>These Loan Conditions will apply to each Loan Contract entered into through the
  Lending Platform. Capitalised terms not otherwise defined in these Loan Conditions have
  the meaning given in clause 16.</p>


  <h3>1. Loan Approval, Drawdown and Disbursement</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Once each of your Confirmed Bid has been matched with each Lender’s Market Offer (and you have electronically counter-signed a credit agreement with any Lending Business), Zopa will provisionally credit your Zopa Wallet with the total amount you have borrowed, less the Borrowing Fee, but actual payment of this amount to your Nominated Account is (or directly to the supplier(s), if any, referred to in clause 1.2) subject to:

      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
        <li>you providing Zopa with certain additional information which Zopa will ask you for, provided that this additional information and the information you gave Zopa before making the Confirmed Bid is not found by Zopa to be inaccurate or deficient in any respect (if Zopa discovers that it was, then the Loan Contract will be void and Zopa will report this information to credit reference and fraud agencies);</li>
        <li>Zopa checking your Credit Rating and the information you provide Zopa to assess the affordability of your Repayments. You acknowledge that credit reference agencies link together the records of you and anyone that you have advised is a financial associate (e.g. someone with whom you have a joint credit account) including previous and subsequent names of parties to the account. Links between financial associates will remain on your, and their, credit reference files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the credit reference agencies. When assessing the affordability of your Repayments, Zopa may take into account Information about your financial associates in your credit reference.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>As soon as reasonably practicable after satisfactory completion of the checks under clause 1.1, you authorize Zopa to, and Zopa shall disburse to the supplier(s), if any, specified under "Other Financial Information" on the first page of the Loan Contract the amount(s) there specified as being payable for the items there specified; and as to the remaining balance (if any) of the Amount of Credit, directly to your Nominated Bank Account.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>2. Payment</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>You must repay the total amount payable under each Loan Contract by paying the
    Repayments on the Repayment Date shown in the Loan Contract or, where you enter into more than one Loan Contract at or about the same time, the relevant Loan Contract Summary. Prompt payment is essential.
    If you are late in paying a Repayment, in addition to the right to enforce the Loan
    Contract, you must pay interest on the Repayment from when it is due until when it is
    paid at the interest rate represented by the Rate of Interest.</li>

    <li>Your obligation to make such Repayments will be satisfied by making payments into
    the Zopa Customers' Account or such other bank account as Zopa may approve.</li>

    <li>Each Repayment will be pro-rated between the Lenders in accordance with each Loan
    Contract and used:
      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
        <li>first pay any arrears of principal and interest under the Loan Contract;</li>
        <li>then to pay the interest and principal due under the latest monthly Repayment that is due and payable under the Loan Contract;</li>
        <li>then to pay any fees, charges, costs or expenses due to Zopa or any third party under the Loan Contract.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>All Repayments will be made to the Lender without deduction of income tax.</li>

    <li>If your personal or employment circumstances change (other than your ability to make
    one or more Repayments at all) you may wish to change the date upon which you make your
    Repayments, in which case.

      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
        <li>You may ask Zopa to change the Repayment Date by notifying Zopa that you wish to do so and specifying the new date within the month upon which you wish your Repayments to take place. Such requests may be made by logging-in to MyZopa and following the instructions there, or by email to contactus@zopa.com or by calling us at the general contact number shown on the Lending Platform (such calls will be recorded to confirm your consent to the change).</li>

        <li>Depending on whether the revised Repayment Date is before or after the original Repayment Date in the month, the amount of your next Repayment on the new Repayment Date will be adjusted to take account of the number of days between the new Repayment Date and the previous one. The remaining Repayments (assuming no further changes) will revert to the usual Repayment amount.</li>

        <li>Zopa will then acknowledge and confirm the new Repayment Date and any change to the amount of your next Repayment as a result, before effecting any change. Depending on how you request the change, this acknowledgement and confirmation will take place online, during the course of your telephone call or by an exchange of email with you.</li>

        <li>Zopa may request justification for the change to the Repayment Date and reserves the right not to complete the request if in its sole and absolute discretion it determines that the change is not due to an appropriate change in circumstances or that the process set out above is not being followed.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      In the event that you become entitled to a refund of any amount paid by Zopa to a supplier under clause 1.2, you hereby transfer to Zopa your right to that refund, and agree that the proceeds of any such refund shall be credited to the Zopa Customers’ Account and to your Zopa Wallet towards repayment of the amount outstanding in respect of each Loan Contract; and, in the event that your Loan Contract is discharged as a result of such payment, any surplus shall be paid by us to your Nominated Bank Account within 30 days after such discharge.
    </li>
  </ol>


  <h3>3. Early Settlement</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>You may at any time settle your Loan Contract early and end the Loan Contract in whole
    or in part by following the instructions in My Zopa or as notified by the Collection Agency
    and repaying the full or partial amount you wish to repay.</li>

    <li>You agree that Zopa or the Collections Agency will, on the
    Lenders' behalf, demand Repayment of the full amount owed by you under your Loan
    Contract if you:

      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
        <li>pay late for more than two consecutive months;</li>

        <li>have lied in a way which affects the decision to allow you to register as a Zopa
        Customer; or</li>

        <li>die, become bankrupt or make a voluntary applicable with people you owe money
        to.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Before making any demand, Zopa will take all the steps the Lenders are required to
    take by law for your protection.</li>
  </ol>


  <h3>4. Charges and missing payments</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>To borrow via the Lending Platform, you must pay Zopa (a) the applicable Borrowing Fee,
    which will be included in the Amount of Credit; and (b) the monthly Loan Servicing Fee,
    which will be deducted from each Repayment.</li>

    <li>To take advantage of the Fast-Track service - where if your application is
    successful you receive the credit sum within one working day of approval - you will be
    charged the applicable Fast Track Fee.</li>

    <li>Missing payments could have severe consequences, including commencement of legal
    proceedings and an adverse report on your credit history, which may make obtaining
    credit more difficult.</li>

    <li>If you are late in making payment, the Collections Agency may charge you an
    administration fee for the work it does in attempting to collect your Repayments ("Late
    Payment Fee"). The Late Payment Fee will be 22.5% of the amount that is overdue (which
    amount shall include any interest that accrues on overdue amounts) except where a field
    agent is required as part of the collections process, in which case the Late Payment
    Fee will be 40% of the amount overdue. The Collections Agency reserves the right to
    change the percentage charged (over which neither the Lenders nor Zopa has any
    control).</li>

    <li>Other fees or charges that may be charged by Zopa or the Collections Agency in
    relation to the Loan Contract and added to the balance outstanding are:

      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
        <li>Tracing charges (for finding you if you cannot be contacted by Zopa or the
        Collections Agency) - £25</li>

        <li>Charges for document retrieval and copying up to 20 pages (other than as a result
        of statutory entitlement, for which there may still be a charge as provided by
        statute) - £35</li>

        <li>Debt counselling service (if you fall into arrears and Zopa or the Collections
        Agency cannot contact you) - £80</li>

        <li>Litigation costs and expenses, including legal fees and expenses, to cover
        litigation recovering outstanding arrears, in which case you will be advised of the
        cost if such action proves necessary.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>You will be notified by Zopa or the Collections Agency if these charges change in nature or amount and of the reason for the change. If you do not agree to the change you may settle your Loan Contract early by following the instructions at clause 3.</li>
  </ol>


  <h3>5. Statement of Account</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>You have the right to receive, on request, and free of charge, at any time
    throughout the duration of the Loan Contract, a statement in the form of a table
    showing:

      <ol>
        <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">the details of each Repayment owing under
        the Loan Contract;</li>

        <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">the date on which each Repayment is due,
        the amount and any conditions relating to the payment of the Repayment;</li>

        <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">a breakdown of each Repayment showing how
        much comprises:

          <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">capital Repayment,</li>

            <li style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">interest payment, and,</li>

            <li style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">if applicable, any other charges.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>


  <h3>6. Other costs that are not paid via Zopa, the Lenders or imposed by
  them</h3>

  <p>You are responsible for any telecommunications charges, digital television
  subscription or other charges for the time you spend accessing the Lending Platform via the
  Internet or any wireless, television or other relevant network.</p>


  <h3>7. Assignment of Loan Contracts</h3>

  <ol>
